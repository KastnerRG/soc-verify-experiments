Changes in your design (including the PCW configuration settings) are not automatically exported from Vivado to Amd's SDK, Petalinux or Yocto.
This is by design to avoid disrupting existing embedded development efforts. To have any changes of your design taking effect in the embedded software flow please export your
design by going through Vivado's main menu, click on File, then Export finally select Export Hardware, please ensure you click on the Include BitStream option.
The auto-generated HDF file is all you need to import in Amd's SDK, Petalinux or Yocto for your changes to be reflected in the Embedded Software Flow.
